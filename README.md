# Passing Data 2

## Project Objectives

1) Display a list of movies

2) For each movie in the list:
    * If the movie has been favorited, then display a list of all users who favorited.
    * Else the movie has not been favorited, then display text stating no one has favorited it.

3) As you work the project, try to make the app *modular* by breaking it into reusable React components.
